		/* ------------------------------------------------------------------
		 * Left sidebar: the composer card's material.
		 *
		 * The background plugin (deepseek-harness-background) paints the app
		 * frame plus the sidebar fill transparent so every column shares one
		 * wallpaper, but its frosted glass is a WHITELIST and the sidebar is
		 * not on it -- so the sidebar is left translucent WITHOUT frost and the
		 * art shows through, leaving the sidebar and the conversation column
		 * reading as one undivided sheet.
		 *
		 * The fill is --dsw-specific-input-major, the very token the painter
		 * overrides on body for the composer card, so the two surfaces cannot
		 * drift apart.
		 *
		 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
		 * WHY THERE IS NO backdrop-filter HERE. Do not add one back.
		 *
		 * Measured, not theorised -- the sidebar hosts fixed-position popovers
		 * (the Cordis/plugin-market panel, the chat-import panel) and they are
		 * DESCENDANTS of .hHd-Xa_root. A `backdrop-filter` other than none
		 * makes its element a containing block for fixed-position descendants,
		 * so the popovers stopped being laid out against the viewport and
		 * started being laid out against the sidebar: a 420px panel collapsed
		 * into the sidebar's ~208px width and its content was cut off.
		 *
		 * The correlation held across four configurations: filter on the root
		 * broke them, filter off the root (plugin stopped, or filter moved to a
		 * pseudo-element) fixed them, and it reproduced on this permanent
		 * bundle when the filter came back. The only way that pattern exists is
		 * the containing-block mechanism above.
		 *
		 * A `z-index:-1` pseudo-element was also tried, twice, and is worse: the
		 * fill and sheen then compete for stacking order with the sidebar's own
		 * content and paint over it. Nothing here may ride a negative z-index.
		 *
		 * So the sidebar keeps the FILL and the SHEEN -- which is what actually
		 * separates it from the conversation column -- and gives up the blur.
		 * That is a deliberate trade: a working sidebar with slightly less
		 * frosting than the composer card, instead of a sidebar that traps the
		 * user's dialogs. If the blur is ever wanted back, it needs the popovers
		 * moved out of the sidebar's DOM first; it cannot be won with CSS here.
		 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ */

		 * Workspace (project) row in the sidebar.

		 * The rounded hover rectangle becomes a resting state, so a workspace

		 * live in a child subtree, so they never match ._projectRow.
		 *
		 * Its title is bold and centred in the space to the right of the folder

		 * Keep the last message readable above the composer.
		 *
		 * The composer seat is `position: sticky; bottom: 0` INSIDE this scroll
		 * container, with a gradient mask on its top edge, so scrolling to the end
		 * parks the final line behind it and the user cannot read it.
		 *
		 * The clearance goes on the message column's LAST CHILD, never on the
		 * scroll container itself. padding on the container pushed the composer
		 * seat (its child) into mid-air -- that mistake is why this targets
		 * :last-child instead. A bottom margin on the last flow item simply opens
		 * room at the end of the content, leaving the seat where it belongs.
		 *
		 * The amount is the kernel's own measured composer height, so it tracks the
		 * composer as it grows (tool row, attachments, multi-line input).
